                <h1>Early History</h1>
                <img src="public/images/IMG_20191214_113112.jpg" className="profilepic"></img>
                <p>Greetings! I was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States of America when I was about 4 years old. I grew up in California, where I spent most of my life. Initially got my degree in physical
                    therapy where I worked in various settings including outpatient rehab, hospital setting, neuro rehab, and home health. </p>
                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>Some of the things that I enjoy doing on my free time include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing Basketball</li>
                    <li>Snow Hiking</li>
                    <li>Camping</li>
                    <li>Making YouTube videos</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Come to think of it, it's hard to really describe what a person's hobbies and interests are. My interests always change so we'll see happens in a few years! </p>
                <h2>Work/ Life Experience</h2>
                <p>I got my degree at CalPoly Pomona with a Bachelors Degree in Exercise Science. Initially, I had no idea what I wanted to do in my life, but my mother had given me the idea to become a Physical Therapist, so 
                    that's what I focused on. After graduating to get my Bachelors Degree, I immediately went to pursue my doctorate in Physical Therapy at Western University of Health Sciences.</p>
                <p>From there, I have been working as a physical therapist for a little over 12 years now. It doesn't feel like its been that long, but wow does a decade of working in the same profession really fly!</p>
                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                <p>After practicing in my respective field for well over a decade now, a part of me wanted to pursue something else. The sudden experience of performing relatively routine work day in and day out 
                    had me started to question my purpose in life. I'm sure many people have probably hit this at some point in their lives, but for me it came on at the age of 33. I wanted something different and although there
                    are moments where physical therapy can be rewarding, the repetitive nature of the job had me longing for something more challenging. That is where I decided to go back to school and pursue my degree in Computer Science.
